Question and Answer game!


<!--PSEUDO CODE-->

<!--I am making an interactive question and answer game.

Therefore, I will need buttons. I will need classes and ID's for the use of CSS 

I need a start button I need a "next" button (shuffle?) 

I will need a card  I will need hide classes> I will need containers

Obviously, JavaScript, so i will need to connect JS/CSS to the index.
I need to make classes for targeting via JS

Make sure i update regularly with Git.

I want to use border-ratio for the card/buttons in the css.

Differnt colors for the correct answers. and red for the wrong answers.

I need different questions!
maybe four or five questions-right answers and wrong-answers




so.. I need IF/Else statments in JS jQuery to cycle the questions.

probably I need a header...

reset padding and margins...
font family maybe from google...


MAKE Varibles-try using const and let..they are similare to class/ID in usage...
will be using document.getElementById.on.("click", (event))

I will need eventListeners.on("click")

lots of DIVs

use Semantic HTML where available-header,-footer, Section,
